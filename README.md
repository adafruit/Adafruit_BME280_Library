This is a library for the Adafruit BME280 Humidity, Barometric Pressure + Temp sensor

Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit BME280 Breakout 
 * http://www.adafruit.com/products/2652

These sensors use I2C or SPI to communicate, up to 4 pins are required to interface

Use of this library also requires [Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
to be installed on your local system.
